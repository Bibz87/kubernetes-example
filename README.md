## :grey_question: Why

After some searching on the internet, I wasn't able to find a complete
Kubernetes installation tutorial that included all the features I wanted for my
home cluster. I've collected bits and pieces of multiples sources and combined
them into a single cluster setup example. This repository is the result of my
research, trial and error and personal preferences.

## :computer: Installation

All cluster components are managed with Helm charts and can be installed mostly
independently. For detailed installation instructions, please see the related
[document](./Installation.md)

## :gear: Usage

Cluster access is documented [here](https://docs.k3s.io/cluster-access).
